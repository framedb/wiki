alias:: FDR

- FDR-style frames are popular American frame family from [[1950s]] and [[1960s]]
- It seems to be very popular among powerful men due to its bold looks
	- It's very popular back then, and even brought back in period films like A Complete Unknown, where it was worn by multiple characters who are depicted as those further up the food chain
- Modern companies like Julius Tart still manufactures and sells this frame
- # Unmarked FDR frames
	- ## What is unmarked?
		- We believe the FDR frames were so popular that all manufacturers rushed to produce them to capture the market share
		- This led to many "prototypes" or unrefined versions among the examples
		- Some of these lack any meaningful identification, except for the country of origin (usually USA)
		- We call these frames *unmarked*, because the markings are too ambiguous for us to determine their manufacturers
			- **Example**: this is unmarked because the marking only says USA

			- **Anti-example**: this is *not unmarked*! It's marked with [[SRO logo]]([[SRO]]), so we can discern the manufacturer

		- These examples usually lack manufacturer names, and most likely will only say `USA`, `Made in USA`, or `Handmade in USA`
	- ## Example 1 #Photographs
		- Amber `USA 6`, possibly from [[1950s]] because its temples are not [reinforced]([[Reinforcement]])
