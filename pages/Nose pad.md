- # Types

		- To repair, we'll have to replace the whole of nose pads and connect the new replacement to the frame
	- ## With [[Nose arm]]
		- Nose pads on that come with nose arms are usually smaller
		- These nose pads allow some degree of freedom for movement and adjustment
		- This type of construction allows the nose pads to be separately replaced, keeping the old nose arms connected to the frame
