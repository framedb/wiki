#[[Tart Optical]]

- Tart Arnel is a [[Acetate]] prescription frame best known for being staple of any vintage eyewear collections
- Arnels sold for a very long time, allegedly from early [[1950s]] up until [[1980s]], so there're many variations
- Most variants can be distinguished by the references, stamping, and details on the temples
- [[Arnel-style]] frames refer to copycats of the original Tart Arnel, mostly from modern companies like Moscot and other "vintage-inspired" brands
- # Features
	- 7-barreled [hinges]([[Hinge]])
	- In older examples, the temples are stamped with make and size, while newer examples feature printed text
	- In newer examples, e.g. from [[1970s]] or [[1980s]], Arnels might feature ornately finished reinforcement steel bar in the temples
