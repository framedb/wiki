- Tart Arnel is an [acetate]([[Acetate]]) [ophthalmic]([[Ophthalmic]]) frame best known for being staple of any vintage eyewear collections
- Arnels sold for a very long time, allegedly from early #1950s up until #1980s, so there're many variations
- Most variants can be distinguished by the references, stamping, and details on the temples
- [[Arnel-style]] frames refer to copycats of the original TOE Arnel, mostly from modern companies like Moscot and other "vintage-inspired" brands
