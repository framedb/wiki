- # History
	- Tart Optical Enterprises Inc was founded in 1948 by Julius Tart, in New York
	- After WW2, raw material supply for eyewear manufacturing was stressed
	- Julius saw how the French had already begun using [[Acetate]] to substitute [[Steel]] and [[Horn]] after the war. The new French designs uses acetate for almost the whole frame, except for some hardware like hinges and screws
	- Just right after adopting the new material, Julius began to improve the acetate construction to make acetate more acceptable as a replacement
		- He began by adding [[Reinforcement]] to the frames
		- He then also improve Tart finishing techniques
	- This made TOE very reputable among New Yorkers and "sophisticated people" and actors, more like Saab of the eyewear world
	- In [[1970s]], TOE began to begin an economy line, branded *Regency Eyewear*, which is more casual compared to original TOE offerings

	- ## [[Julius Tart Optical]]
		- Tart Optical Enterprises was first revived by his Newphew Richard Tart
		- Julius Tart Optical has probably no connection to the old Tart, except for the family bond between Richard and Julius
		- Richard chose to have his new frames produced in Japan, which is the best place to make eyewear since 1980s
		- Julius Tart Optical is still operational today, selling popular models like Ar ([[Tart Optical Arnel]] reproduction), FDR ([[FDR-style frames]] reproduction), and other models
		- Because Julius Tart basically *reverse engineered* the blueprints for the frames, they never claim that they still use the same old block used by the old Tart in the old days
		- For example, with Arnel, we can clearly see the differences between the vintage example and the reproduction
			- The nose pads are much larger in Julius Tart, to sell to Japanese and other Asian peoples
			- The frames appear to be a little bit more thick than the original
	- ## (New, revived) Tart Optical Enterprises
		- Around the turn of the century (probably 1997-98), Julius announced his intention to sell the company along with its factory
		- Some unknown buyer bought the company, and continue to make more frames claiming to use the old molds, tools, QC process, and all that
