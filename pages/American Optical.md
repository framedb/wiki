		- (1826) **William Beecher** set up a watch and jewelry shop in **Southbridge, Massachusetts**
			- ![beecher.jpg](../assets/beecher_1744122708385_0.jpg)
		- (1833) Proto-AO was established in Beecher's shop upstairs workspace
			- Beecher had seen British spectacles, and knew he could do better
			- [Early Beecher spectacles were made with silver]([[Silver]]), reflecting Beecher's legacy as a jeweler
				- ![beecher_silver.jpg](../assets/beecher_silver_1744122848498_0.jpg)
			- Beecher had hired 7 workers, who were able to put out 1 pair per day per worker
		- (1839) Beecher sold jewelry shop to apprentice **Robert Cole**, and moved proto-AO to new factory
			- Beecher sold the jewelry business (to focus more on AO) to Robert Cole, his first apprentice jeweler.
			  ![robert_cole.jpg](../assets/robert_cole_1744126388524_0.jpg)
			- Beecher then moved his spectacle business to the first factory **the Old Spec Shop** on lower Main Street, also in Southbridge, Massachusetts

			  ![beecher_1st_factory.jpg](../assets/beecher_1st_factory_1744123255895_0.jpg)
		- (1840) Beecher sold proto-AO to Ammidown
			- The business was sold to **Holdridge Ammidown** and **Jairus Putney**, and later became **Ammidown & Son**, then **Ammidown & Co**
			- Though Beecher remained briefly after the sales to teach Ammidown’s son Lucius
			- Note that Holdridge Ammidown is related to both Beecher and Cole:
				- Related to Beecher, who married Ammidown’s sister
				- Related to Cole, who married Ammidown’s daughter
		- (1843) Proto-AO began selling [frames made of US steel]([[Steel]]) - a cheaper material compared to silver
		- (1851) Beecher reentered spectacles business with Cole as **Beecher and Cole**
			- By 1852 Beecher and Cole produced a total of 14,919 pairs of silver, steel, and gold spectacles
		- (1862) Beecher retired, and their company became **Robert Cole & Co**
		- (1864) **George Washington Wells** joined Cole, and excelled at metal frame-making
			- Wells later went on to apply his knowledge to other industries, earning him multiple patents
			- ![george_wells.jpg](../assets/george_wells_1744126431810_0.jpg)
		- (1864-1869) Wells bought another Southbridge-based frame making company from Henry Ammidown and Charles Edmonds
			- Cole tried to convince Wells to join Cole as partner, but that failed
			- Cole wanted Wells because he was very innovative - innovating new machines to help with productions one after the other
		- (1869) The **American Optical Company** was established from merger of Cole's and George's companies
			- $40,000 capital
			- 400 shares
				- Cole (now President) owned 150
				- Wells owned 40
			- 85 employees
		- (1872) Wells bought Central Mills for a new factory
			- This was around the time Southbridge was pivoting from a textile mill town to optical manufacturing town
			- Located at Main and Mechanic Street near the [Old Spec Shop](((67f536cf-b236-409b-845e-803b836a546b)))

		- > During this time, AO only produced frames. Lenses were still bought from [European cottage industry](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cottage_industry)
		  >
		  > For some context - lens customers around this time would first need to try on pre-made *spherical lenses* and choose what served them best.
		  >
		  > This meant that astigmatism customers were not well served at the time
		  >
		  > Also, the Wells are very close to the Lomb, and they both went to DC together to lobby for the continuation of tariffs on imported glass
		- (1884) AO hired lens expert Charlie Wilson #lens
			- After a year of trial and error, AO finally successfully made spherical lenses from imported lens blanks
			- This helps expanded the business very aggressively since it cut lead time for finished European lenses, which was usually a year long
			- Flat biconcave and biconvex lenses were replaced by AO’s first production lens, the Centex
			- AO supplied not only white glass, but also blue, smoked, amber, pink, amethyst, and eupos
		- (1887) AO made 1.5 million pairs of spectacles and employed 400 people
			- This increase was mainly due to electricity taking over as power source, replacing water
		- (1890) Cole retired as president, with Wells replacing him
			- Wells was later joined by his sons Channing, Albert, and Cheney in the 1890’s
			- Channing Wells
			  ![channing_wells.jpg](../assets/channing_wells_1744126310539_0.jpg)
			- Albert Wells
			  ![albert_wells.jpg](../assets/albert_wells_1744126333161_0.jpg)
			- Cheney Wells
			  ![cheney_wells.jpg](../assets/cheney_wells_1744126353755_0.jpg)
		- (1893) AO became the world's largest, with 2 millions frames produced and 800 employees
			- The workforce was mostly Francophone immigrants from Canada, who just immigrated to Southbridge
		- ## AO *firsts* by 1800s

		- > Note: Between 1911-1927, the trademark `Wellsworth` was used and became some what better known compared to AO. This led AO to try to bring more attention to its marketing names
