- #[[American Optical]] #1950s #1960s
- Although eyewear parts in the US is heavily standardized compared to in Europe, manufacturers could still slide a little innovation in there for a marketing and differentiation trick, like what Levi's did with the Arch and the Red Tab
- In 1955, AO came up with a way to improve upon the standard hinge screws, stating:
  > *American Optical Company announces that it’s new red dot program will be available nationwide very soon. This innovation, according to AO, has been acclaimed in the aereas where it has already been introduced.
  >
  > Red Dot, so called because of the identifying mark on each piece, provides a new means for fastening temples to fronts. It eliminates the problem of lost screws and loose temples, says the company, adding that proper tension at the hinge is assured for the normal life of the frame.
  >
  > The red dot mark is on a tubular rivet of new design and which incorporates a nylon bushing. A precision machine is supplied to seal the rivets in hinges that have been drilled and reamed. The machine will accommodate 3-, 5-, and 7- barrels, and assures the right amount of expansion of the bushing to guarantee a firm hinge tension that will not change with use.
  >
  > The machine also has a device for removal of the rivets if a change of temples is required.
  >
  > Only the newest AO frame will accommodate the new fastenings.  All new models being prepared by the frame division will use the red dots.*
- We started seeing red dots popping up in later part of [[1950s]], and then it became a staple during [[1960s]] for pricier AO models.
- We haven't found the the red dot in any [[AO Safety frames]].
- # Variations
	- ## Round drive
		- We found round red dots in older frames
		- We then assume that this is the original version of the red dot system.
		- It features a screw with rounded screw head and a rounded *driver*
	- ## Slotted drive
		- We found this variants in use more in [[1960s]] frames
		- We then assume that this is the later variant
