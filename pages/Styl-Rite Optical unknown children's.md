#[[Styl-Rite Optical]]

- I bought an [[Acetate]] SRO frame off eBay, but the model was unknown
- After a while, w've come across a few examples of this type, so we think it's quite worth it to document something like this coming from SRO
- # Features
	- 7-barreled hinges
	- [Reinforced temples]([[Reinforcement]])
- # Photographs
	- Example 1
		- I found this example on eBay and bought it for around $90

	- Examples from [@after1900s on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/after1900s/)
		- I found these examples on sale on Instagram, and they come in children's sizes, which is why I assume this model to be for children
