- #OldFrames is an open-source wiki based on Logseq for vintage eyewear information
- The main point is to consolidate all information in a knowledge base where everything can be indexed and retrieved easily, enabling cross references
- We focus mostly on vintage [American and German/Austrian glasses](logseq://graph/wiki?page=Manufacturers), mostly from 1950s onwards
- We do not claim to be anywhere near authoritative, and please feel free to correct any mistakes
