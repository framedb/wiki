- Plastics are organic compounds known for their plasticity
- First documented use of plastics for frames was Spencer Optical’s Celluloid patent
- # [[Bakelite]]
	- Discovered: 1904
	- Widespread use, including a lot of items in common household items and machine guns
	- Cons:
		- Cracks in cold weather
- # [[Cellulose nitrate]] (Zylonite, Zyl, and nitrocellulose)

	- Cheap plastics made from cotton, hence common names **flash paper**, **flash cotton**, **guncotton**, **pyroxylin**, **flash string**
	- The Zylonite name comes from the [American Zylonite Company](https://digitalcollections.syr.edu/Documents/Detail/american-zylonite-company/288087)
		- The American Zylonite Company manufactured and sold the compound with license from Daniel Spill's British **Xylonite** Company
		- It was very popular, so Zylonite became household names
	- Is very shiny
	- Widespread use: piano keys, billiard ball, nail polish, photographic film emulsion, automobile lacquer and paint coating, and [as celluloid (i.e. for eyewear frames)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid)
		- Now banned for eyewear use
	- Cons:
		- Highly flammable
- # [[Cellulose acetate]]
	- Actually first appeared in 1864
	- Made from woodpulp
	- Successor to ((67fd7414-38a9-4cc5-bf67-7bfde52591b9))
		- > People usually confuse the acetate with nitrate or and zyl-stuff, and some FrameDB page might still contains errors. This page should be authoritative for FrameDB regarding the plastic materials
	- Came about in frame manufacturing just in time with the rise of popularity for cat-eye  and [[Brow-line]] glasses
	- Cons:
		- Difficult maintenance
- # [[Nylon]]
	- First synthesized: 1935
	- Very flexible if not dried out
	- Sometimes only used in eye wires, and comes separately from the frame
	- Cons:
		- Very brittle if dried out
- # [[Optyl]]
	- Patented by [[Carrera Eyewear Company]]: 1964
	- Brand name for an epoxy resin
	- 30% lighter than [[Cellulose acetate]]

	- [[Bakelite]] was first used during early 1900s after being discovered in 1904
	- [[Zylonite]] was first used around the same time as Bakelite, but it persisted longer and remained in use until [[1930s]]
	- [[Acetate]] replaces Zylonite, and continues to dominate
	- [[Nylon]] First synthesized in 1935 #1930s
	- [[Optyl]] First used in 1964 by Carrera #1960s
