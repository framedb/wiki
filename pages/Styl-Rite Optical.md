alias:: SRO

- Styl-Rite Optical is an #American manufacturer of eyewear, with quite obscure history
- From what we know, SRO was in business in the #1950s , and it was still operational as of #1970s
- # Frames
	- [[Styl-Rite Optical 820]]
	- [[Styl-Rite Optical FDR]]
	- [[Styl-Rite Optical unknown children's]]
- # [SRO acetate]([[Acetate]]) quality
	- We've come across maybe 3 SRO frames from #1950s and #1960s, and they are not in the greatest shape
		- [1 of them]([[Styl-Rite Optical unknown children's]]) has degraded acetate - it sweats, and reeks of vinegar. But as of now still not showing signs of shrinkage, and the surface is not dried yet
		- My [[SRO FDR]] , despite looking sharp and not at all dried, smells like vinegar, and yellow-hued discoloration also begins to develop
		- My [[SRO 820]] appears to have been polished, but the temple edges have been beginning to look dried out, though this can be restored with some oil application.
			- The 820 is also starting to smell, but not as bad as the 2 frames mentioned above
	- But we've also come across a NOS example from probably #1960s, and here the acetate looks flawless
	- In our experience and opinion, we'd say SRO acetate quality is like with [[Tart Optical]] - not the best, worse than [[American Optical]], but not too bad.
