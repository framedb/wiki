# Introducing the OldFrames Wiki
	- OldFrames Wiki provides open source, Logseq-powered, community references for vintage eyewear frames
		- Despite eyewear being very pervasive in the last century, has not been documented well enough.
	- Information about vintage glasses are difficult to verify, and most of the time the sources of truth come from scans of past brochures or photographs of people wearing them.
		- Unless we have hard evidence like a photograph or a scan, most information cannot be verified truthfully.
	- OldFrames Wiki aim to not only provide frame references, but also other information relating to collecting and maintaining vintage glasses
